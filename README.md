# PyRadio
PyRadio is a Python platform used to simulate the LoRa Radio propagation for an IoT project. This repo was forked from PyLayers, tool for Site Specific Radio Propagation Simulation.

PyRadio is a portable version of the more complex PyLayers analyzer. You need only to install all the dependency and put in the '_dem' folder the .tif file related to you spot point.
